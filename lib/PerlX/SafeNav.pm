=head1 NAME

PerlX::SafeNav - Safe-navigation for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Wrap a chain of method calls to make it resilient on encountering C<undef> values in the middle:

    use PerlX::SafeNav ('$safenav', '$unsafenav', 'safenav');

    my $answer = safenav {
        $_->a()->{b}->c()->[42]->d()
    } $o;

    my $tire_age = $car -> $safenav
         -> wheels()
         -> [0]               # undef, if no wheels at all.
         -> tire()            # undef, if no tire on the wheel.
         -> {created_on}
         -> delta_days($now)
         -> $unsafenav;

    unless (defined $tire_age) {
        # The car either have no wheels, or the first wheel has no tire.
        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Background

In many other languages, there is an operator (often C<?.>) doing
"Safe navigation", or "Optional Chaining".  The operator does a
method-call when its left-hand side (first operant) is an object.  But
when the left-hand side is an undefined value (or null value), the
operator returns but evaluates to C<undef>.

For perl there is currently an PPC: L<Optional Chaining|https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0021-optional-chaining-operator.md>

This module provides a mean of making chains of method call safe
regarding undef values. When encountering an C<undef> in the middle of
a call chain like C<< $o->foo()->bar()->baz() >>, the program would die
with a message like this:

    Can't call method "bar" on an undefined value

With the help of this module, instead of making the program die, the
call chain is reduced to C<undef>.

=head2 Usages

=head3 C<$safenav> and C<$unsafenav>

With this module, instead of using a different operator, we wrap a
chain of calls to make it safe with the imported C<$safenav> and
C<$unsafenav>. C<$safenav> must be placed at the beginning, while
C<$unsafenav> must be place at the end. The should be invoked as
method calls, like this:

    $obj-> $safenav
        -> a()
        -> {b}
        -> [0]
        -> c()
        -> $unsafenav;

Notice that it is possible to mix all three kinds method calls, hash
fetches, and array fetches together in the same chain. If any of the 4
sub-expresions returns C<undef>, the entire chain upto C<$unsafenav>
would also be evaluated to C<undef>. (For this reason, you probably
don't want to concatenate more sub-expressions after C<$unsafenav>.)

This module provide 2 symbols are both C<$>-sigiled scalar variables,
this is on purpose, so that they could be called as methods on
arbitrary scalar values.

It is mandatory to have both C<$safenav> and C<$unsafenav> together in
the same chain. Without C<$unsafenav>, the original return value of
the chain would be forever wrapped inside the mechanism of
C<PerlX::SafeNav>.

While being unconventional in their look, one benifit is that the
chance of having naming conflicts with methods from C<$o> should be very
small. However, be aware that C<$safenav> and C<$unsafenav> would be
masked by locally-defined variables with the same name.

=head3 safenav block

A block syntax is also provided by importing the C<safenav> symbol explicitly:

    use PerlX::SafeNav ('safenav');

    my $answer = safenav {
        $_ ->a()->{b}->[0]->c()
    } $o;

Inside this C<safenav> block, C<$_> is the safenav-wrapped version of C<$o>, and the chain is automaticly un-wrapped at the end. C<$answer> contains the return value of method C<c()> if no C<undef> values are encountered or otherwise, an C<undef>.

=head2 Bugs

There are likely many unknown bugs, as the current test suite only
covers the minmum set of forms that are known to work.
